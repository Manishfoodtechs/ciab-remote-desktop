##CIAB Remote Desktop System v2.2 Release Notes  

CIAB has had a redesign of how the CIAB Web App Containers are created.   

Previously, in v2.1 they were created as "nested" LXD containers inside the ciab-guac container.

Due to a couple bugs in Apparmor that are related to "nested" Apparmor profiles which may take quite a while to be resolved I have redesigned how the CIAB Web Apps are deployed.   They are now created as normal LXD (ie non-nested) containers at the same container level as the ciab-guac and CN1 containers.

> Note:  the Web App containers and their applications are still isolated to the private 10.x.x.x network and still  accessible by Remote Desktop users of the CN1 environment.    Those Web App containers also still retain access to the Internet but are isolated from direct access "from" the Internet.
CIAB version 2.2 introduces the following improvements.

Any CIAB Web-Apps installed by the CIAB Admin from the Menu available on their CIAB-GUAC container Mate Desktop now get installed in LXD Containers as “peer containers” on the 10.x.x.x private network that CIAB-GUAC and CN1 containers are on. 

This is a change from CIAB’s previous use of “nested” containers for the CIAB Web-Apps and was driven by a bug in upstream
Apparmor concerning “nested” Apparmor profiles. That bug may be a while before it is fixed so a decision was made to make this change.

Now *as Admin*, from the Host/Server you can find/see all installed applications and the CIAB-GUAC
and CN1 containers and their IP addresses by executing:

> $ lxc list

Also, in CIAB v2.2, **TOTP (Timed One Time Password) 2 Factor Authentication (2FA)** is now an optional capability which the *CIAB Admin* can easily install and it will automatically activate for use by CIAB users logging in afterwards.

> **NOTE**: users will have to have a TOTP compatible application on their smart phones inorder to use TOTP. Google Authenticator works well for this and is available on Android and iPhone.

This Installation Guide now has an *added section describing the 4 steps required to* create an **IPP (Internet Printing Protocol)** Printer in the CN1 *CUPS (Common Unix Printing System)* so users can print directly to their local printers (if those printers support IPP).

Lastly, the CIAB-README.PDF document now also contains a section titled “**Steps to Implement a real/valid HTTPS/TLS Certificate for CIAB**”. This section provides information and a Guide for how to obtain & install a valid Certificate from a Certificate Authority (LetsEncrypt) for use for HTTPS/TLS access to your CIAB installation.

##CIAB Remote Desktop System v2.1 Release Notes  

This update introduces the following improvements and new features.  

Both file uploads and downloads now work between a Users local PC and their CIAB Remote Desktop system.

Entry of a Login ID and Password is now only required one time for both CIAB's Guacamole and the CIAB Remote Desktop connections.  

If a CIAB User only has a single Remote Desktop connection configured for them they will be connected to that Desktop immediately after entering their User ID and Password.
     
> **IMPORTANT NOTE**    
>  
> Please review the **CIAB - README.pdf !**  
>  
>*The PDF has been _significantly_ updated/improved* in regards to not only the new features but also the overall CIAB Installation & Configuration process!  
>
> Some of the new capabilities (such as file download and only requiring Login ID and Password once) will *require* some _minor_ editing of existing CIAB Guacamole **CIAB-GUAC** and **CN1** "connection" configurations for the new capabilities to work correctly!

*Pre-reqs:*  
1 - Fresh Ubuntu 18.04 server (cloud or local) or VM  
2 - The CIAB Remote Desktop system files contained in this GitHub repository which include all of the installation scripts.  
3 - sudo privileges on that server  

Also, note that I have started adding some short _**Tips**_ into this Repository's **Issues** section to help with several topics.

##CIAB Remote Desktop System v2.0 release notes

**NOTE**:  With CIAB Remote Desktop System v2.0 we introduced several major enhancements!

CIAB has been updated with Guacamole v1.0.0 which was released January 2019.   This version of Guacamole now supports many new capabilities such as:

* Support for user groups  
* Multi-factor authentication with Google Authenticator / TOTP  
* Support for RADIUS authentication  
* Support for creating ad-hoc connections  
* Support for renaming RDP drive and printer  
* Cut & Paste for text-only (no pictures) now works as it normally would on a desktop 
* Configurable terminal color schemes  
* Optional recording of input events  
* SSH host key verification  
* Automatic detection of network issues  
* Support for systemd  
* Incorrect status reported for sessions closed by RDP server  
* Automatic connection behavior which means Guacamole will automatically connect upon login for users that have access to only a single connection, skipping the home screen.  

A recent addition to the CIAB Remote Desktop are the CIAB Web Applications!  Previously, this had to be installed separately after the CIAB Remote Desktop system had been installed.   

With CIAB Remote Desktop System v2.0 this has now been integrated so that the CIAB Admin will see an Icon on their Mate Desktop when they log into the CIAB-GUAC LXD container desktop.   

To install one or more of those CIAB Web Apps you just have to click on that Icon and when prompted select "RUN IN A TERMINAL" and after doing so you will be presented with a GUI Menu where you can Check the boxes for one or more Web Applications you'd like to install.

> NOTE:  These applications will be installed as peer LXD containers to the CIAB-GUAC and CN1 containers and they will all be attached to the **same** 10.x.x.x private network that the CIAB-GUAC and the CN1 containers are attached to.   This use of the private 10.x.x.x network has greatly enhanced the security regarding using these Web Applications as only validated users with CIAB Accounts and a login on the CN1 Mate Desktop container will have access to those web applications unless the CIAB Admin allows access from the internet via a separate configuration requirement.

Read more about the CIAB Web Application later in the Section of this README titled "CIAB Web Applications".

These are a large group of Web based applications.  Each selected application is installed in its own LXD container.
